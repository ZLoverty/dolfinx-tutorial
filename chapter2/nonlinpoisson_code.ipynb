    "## Test problem\n",
    "To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right hand side $f$, the coefficient $q(u)$, and the boundary $u_D$. Previously, we have worked with manufactured solutions that can  be reproduced without approximation errors. This is more difficult in nonlinear problems, and the algebra is more tedious. However, we will utilize the UFL differentiation capabilities to obtain a manufactured solution.\n",

    "For this problem, we will choose $q(u) = 1 + u^2$ and define a two dimensional manufactured solution that is linear in $x$ and $y$:"

We can therefore, even with $\\mathcal{P}_1$ elements, expect the manufactured solution to be reproduced by the numerical method.
